# 🚨 Repository Archived

**This repository is now archived.**

It was originally created to store and manage code developed during my internship.  
Since my internship period has now ended, this repository will no longer be maintained or updated.

Feel free to explore the code if you’re interested in my work during that time —  
but please note that it is no longer actively supported.

You can check out my internship reports here:

Thank you for your understanding and interest! 🙏

# 🧮 Group Theory Codes – Internship Project

This repository contains all the code I developed during my research internship under the **Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc)**. 

The project focused on implementing and exploring key concepts in **Group Theory**, a fundamental area of abstract algebra that studies algebraic structures called *groups*.

The project includes implementations and visualizations of key group theory concepts such as groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, and symmetry groups.

## 🧠 Purpose

Created as part of an internship aimed at exploring algebraic structures computationally and deepening understanding of group theoretical concepts.
