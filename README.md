# ðŸ§® Group Theory Codes â€“ Internship Project

This repository contains all the code I developed during my research internship under the **Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc)**. 

The project focused on implementing and exploring key concepts in **Group Theory**, a fundamental area of abstract algebra that studies algebraic structures called *groups*.

The project includes implementations and visualizations of key group theory concepts such as groups, subgroups, homomorphisms, and symmetry groups.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

Created as part of an internship aimed at exploring algebraic structures computationally and deepening understanding of group theoretical concepts.
